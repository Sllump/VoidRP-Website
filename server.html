                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Ignorance of the rules will not grant you leniency, it is your responsibility to

                                        Using microphones on the server is MANDATORY. If your mic happens to break or disconnect, use “/me” to smoothly role play out of a situation until your mic is replaced or fixed.

                                        You may not use in-game bugs, crashes, or any other form of an exploit for gains. Any exploits should be reported to the Admin team immediately using the #tickets channel.
                                        Examples: Using emotes to gain access behind a locked door, canceling the drug sale animation or getting into a vehicle when the animation is still going, creating a new character multiple times and passing the starting money to someone else

                                        Griefing is the act of intentionally angering or irritating another player with malicious intent to get a reaction. It will not be tolerated.
                                        “DEFAULT DANNY” / “MR CLEAN”
                                        VoidRP does not accept “Default Danny” / “Mr Clean” or default character appearance for any player. The bald head, white tshirt, blue jeans, and checkered shoes or black heels for women will not be accepted.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Combat Logging</h4>
                                        If you are engaged in roleplay, you are not allowed to log out just to avoid consequences. You are also not allowed to log out if you are detained or dead/unconscious. We understand if you disconnect from the server because of connectivity issues, real-life emergencies, FiveM crashes or server restarts, but you must engage in the RP you were in prior to disconnecting.
                                        <br>

                                        Breaking character can impact a roleplay scenario significantly and ruin the experience for everyone around you. VoidRP will not tolerate breaking character also known as going out of character unless circumstances are forcing you to do otherwise.
                                        Example: Your lit playlist has started to play Creed and you need to change music immediately. You tell people you’re roleplaying with that you need to “go in your head for a moment” - that’s acceptable. Bad example would be to immediately start mentioning the server rules if a scenario is not what you wanted it to be.

                                        If you are a victim of or a witness to someone breaking the rules, please report it to the admins immediately. A report can be made in Discord using the #tickets channel or doing /report in game. Please include details of the situation so a thorough investigation can be conducted. Video proof is encouraged.

Be ready to provide proper proof and examples for your appeal. Racism, sexism or any form of bigotry will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban with no chance of appeal.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Random Deathmatch</h4>
                                        Random Death Match (RDM) is when a player shoots or assaults another player for no valid in character reason. RDM will not be tolerated and is strictly forbidden. If you down someone with your hands or a weapon without engaging in quality roleplay beforehand, you will receive the appropriate discipline. You are also to give people an incentive and enough time to comply with your orders (e.g during a robbery, do not shoot after 3 seconds if they don’t listen). Note that we do not consider quick countdowns quality roleplay.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Vehicle Deathmatch</h4>
                                        Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM) is never allowed. VDM is when you hit 
                                        someone with your vehicle with the intent to kill them. VDM will not be tolerated and is strictly forbidden.
                                        If you run someone down with your vehicle you will receive appropriate discipline. 
                                        The only case of this allowed is if you currently occupy your vehicle while someone
                                        is actively shooting at you or has a gun at you at close range: this is to get away
                                        from the shooter and you should never hit speeds fast enough to kill them.
                                        You also run the risk of the shooter having good enough aim to down you.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">FearRP</h4>
                                        Fear RP is fearing for your life, which has value and you must act accordingly.
                                        It is the concept that your character is afraid to die.
                                        For example, if someone has a gun pointed at you, put your hands up and listen to the person’s orders. 
                                        You also may not kill yourself just for the sake of dodging consequences, like jumping off of a cliff or drowning on purpose.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">FailRP</h4>
                                        Fail RP is doing things that are not sufficient to be considered good standard roleplay depending on the situation at hand
                                        (running around a crime scene for no reason, dancing and screaming in a trollish manner in a serious situation,
                                        not roleplaying fear appropriately in situations realistically). It is an event surrounding an action that your character commits that is not probable.

                                        Metagaming is using the information you have gotten from out of character means and using it in character. Stream sniping, stalking and asking questions in “/ooc” or Discord that does not support the related scenario is not allowed. Being taken hostage with your comms taken from you and telling your friends OOC to come help and providing them info on your location is meta. All the information you gain should be acquired through roleplay only.
                                        Metagaming earns an immediate 72 hour ban upon a player's first offense and a permanent ban upon the second. Accusations of Metagaming should always be supplemented with undeniable proof of the event. If the player has a whitelisted job, they will lose that job immediately.

                                        Power gaming is the process of gaining an advantage in an RP scenario, either by using in-game mechanics or RP to give other players involved no opportunity to interact or defend themselves. It gives the other people involved in RP no option but to lose.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">TSUNAMI (SERVER SCHEDULED RESTARTS)</h4>
                                        Server scheduled restarts are referred to as tsunamis in character. Restarts happen every couple hours- unless otherwise announced by admins.
                                        When the server announcement warns of the remaining 30 minutes, no new robberies may begin and any currently active (at the location and performing the robbery) will need to be finished soon. At the 15 minute warning, all criminal activity should cease at this point to avoid discipline from admins.
                                        If an unscheduled restart is announced, you need to immediately stop what you’re doing to store any work items you have collected or you will lose them with no reimbursement. If you are in a roleplay scenario, you will need to pick up that scenario when the server is back up. No killing is allowed after the announcement.

                                        Bank robberies, store robberies, and jewelry robberies are limited to players involved as explained below. It is expected as a roleplayer to give the true count outside or inside of how many there are involved so police can roleplay their part properly.

                                        None of your characters know each other or are related; that’s not your cousin. Each character should be treated as an entirely separate person with their own set of life goals, ambitions, friends, job, interests, and personality.

                                        A new life begins when you are downed and your timer allows you to respawn at the hospital either voluntarily or forced. Your character forgets all events leading up to the scenario of being downed. If a witness survives and informs you of what they saw or you are rescued, you can begin to remember vague details, but not the full story. A new life does not begin when you are downed for reasons such as RDM, VDM, or disconnected because of connectivity issues. If you have died and respawned you are not allowed to return to that roleplay scenario at all.

                                        If you are unconscious/downed, roleplay your part! Let the other players know through roleplay the extent of your injuries with “/me”. You must cooperate with the EMS, if available, until they tell you that you are free to leave the scene or hospital. In the event that you are downed in roleplay from fatal injuries, you will describe your injuries with “/me” and you may not be revived. If you are not revived on scene by the EMS you must follow the New Life Rule. If your character is downed due to small injuries or bruises, you are allowed to use your mic for talking. However, you are not allowed to use your mic if your character is dead. A dead person cannot talk in real-life so you cannot talk in roleplay and is considered Fail RP.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Driving</h4>
                                        You may take appropriate vehicles and drive them off-road however you must still fear for your life and act reasonably. High speeds up a steep hill or mountainside on any vehicle is not fearing for your life - no matter off-road or not.
                                        Example: A vehicle that’s not designed to be driven off-road; a Lambo or low suspension vehicles; should not be driven off-road.
                                        When better custom car tuning implementation can be added, this rule will be removed.
                                        Using scummy tactics while driving a car during criminal activity can result in a ban after discussion with staff.

                                        All traffic lights will be utilized as normal; red is stop, yellow is slow down, green is go.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Criminal Organizations and Gangs</h4>
                                        All criminal organizations and gangs of the city will have a maximum of 12 official members within it’s group. Any organization or gang business (meetings, wars, etc) must be conducted by the official members only. Hang-arounds are those that support the group, but can not be active participants during org or gang activities.
                                        Any violent initiation towards another criminal organization or gang from your perspective that is not war related needs to follow a 6 player count. However, if an attack occurs on the Gang’s territory any official members of the opposing side that are available may respond to defend their territory and members.
                                        This rule should not be used to luring cops into territories for the pure benefit of breaking the group of 6.

                                        Let’s do our best to not suck the fun out of being able to roleplay and escape the issues of actual life.
                                        No suicide roleplay
                                        No reenactments of real life tragedies - if you’re unsure, ask a staff member.
