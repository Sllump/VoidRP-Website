                                        <h6 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Can I create a gang/Can I get my gang whitelisted?</h6>
                                        <br>
                                        We have received many questions and tickets about whether people can make gangs/get them whitelisted. We want to see your gang in RP and see how you roleplay before even thinking about a whitelist gang (Whitelist includes a gang hideout, some items to benefit the gang as well as a garage at your "hideout"). With this being said you can rep a gang and a "block" but your whitelist will rely on your roleplay that you provide to the server. Remember you can not rep a gang that is already in the city, as we do not want two gangs fighting over who started first etc. instead please just come to an agreement we all are here to have fun. 
                                        <br>
                                        <h6 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How many members can I have in my gang?</h6>
                                        <br>
                                        You can have up to 12 Members but you are allowed to have people who hang around your block/territory
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        <h6 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Can I Claim a Drug?</h6>
                                        Currently a lot of people are trying to get their hands on drugs but yes gangs can run certain drugs.
                                        Once again this means that if you are trying to run a drug there are gonna be others that might want to interfere
                                        with that so you guys need to hold the spot down for a long time before you can say you run it.
                                        They need to hold down the location for a long time before they get that location to call it
                                        theirs as well as this goes back to the whitelist question your RP provided
                                        on that block/location will impact the outcome.
                                        
                                        <h6 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Can I claim this block for my gang?</h6>
                                        Your gang can claim any block/location that they would like but they need to hold down the location for a long time before they get that location to call it theirs as well as this goes back to the whitelist question your RP provided on that block/location will impact the outcome.

                                        Can I have custom clothing put in for my gang ?
                                        <br>
                                        We will not be adding custom clothing for gangs but we accept chains so that you have something that shows you are part of the gang other than your flag that you wear on your pants, head, etc. Also the chain is to be provided by you
                                        <br>
                                        All gangs must be on their “block” a majority of their time in the city. This doesn't mean you can't leave the block to go make some money etc. but it means if you want to claim that “block” we need to see you on it 24/7 !

                                        Limited to the total number of the gangs in their territory, if driving around then gangs must be limited to the 4 members unless agreed with both gangs and Staff has approved it in a ticket. 
                                        <br>
                                        Something crucial within RP must happen between the two parties in order for a war to happen. A poor reason behind a war can lead to admin intervention.
                                        <br>
                                        You must wait at least 30 minutes between shootouts for each side to regroup and gather more supplies from their block. 
                                        <br>
                                        If you lose the war don't cry to the staff about it. 
                                        <br>
                                        Each gang will have five gang strikes and seven individual strikes.

                                        Individual strikes will be based on the VoidRP Gang ban system that is listed above.
                                        If a person in your gang receives a permanent ban or seven individual strikes you will
                                        receive one gang strike since they were a member representing your gang.
                                        Please note that the individual strikes are Staff's discretion depending on the situation / ban.
                                        <br>
                                        Gang strikes will be handed out if multiple individuals in your gang are banned at one time. We don’t want to discipline the whole gang if certain individuals are acting out. Please note that gang strikes are Staff’s discretion depending on the situations / bans.

                                        <h4 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What we expect from Gang RP</h4>
                                        You sit on your block and sell drugs to civilians/people
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You should not be rolling around looking for trouble, let the trouble come to you
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        We want Serious RP and story telling for your gang/character
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Robberies on any member of your gang does not give you the right to retaliate in anger ( If multiple robberies happen then you can initiate on the other gang).
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Your gang should not be tweeting on twitter at the opps/rival gangs looking to start trouble.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Your gang should let the trouble/beef be done through RP, by this I mean for example. I am the bloods and we run the block down by Grove Street as well as we run the weed location in the city and we find out that the crips are stepping on our toes and taking product from that location and selling it somewhere else. This gives me the blood’s the right to go and speak with the crips or if the crips dont wanna talk this initiates the beef but you need to keep the RP rolling dont just automatically try to kill each other, keep the story building. This is an example of a good storyline/gang arc. Another example. I am the bloods and the crips come and rob one of my boys so we search for them the whole day and when we find them we shoot them and rob them. This is an example of not good storyline/gang arc

                                        If someone is wearing your colors/pieces of your specialized look, minding their own business and hanging out somewhere other than your turf, you should NOT engage with them in a negative way especially on newer players as this can ruin their rp experience instead simply tell them to change there clothes so that they don't get mistaken for a member of your gang .

                                        You are allowed to press a person if they are intentionally imitating your gang to give you a bad reputation.

                                        If you get killed in a gang attack, you can't come back again to the Gang attack.

                                        Civilians are not allowed to join in on the shootout between the two gangs or shootout that had started without them involved

                                        When getting involved in a fist fight do not just wait for the other person to punch because that is powergaming, have a fair fight and if you lose you lose.

                                        Every scenario/scene that you have with anyone no matter who it is let the RP unravel itself, don't automatically bring it to a shootout with another gang or even the cops for that matter. Let the RP flow dont always rely on winning the scene cause a winning mentality will not stick here at Void.

                                        If you are robbing stores or any type of establishment, wait a minimum of 1hour until you go to rob another one. If robbing houses then you are required to wait 30min before doing another. If you rob a store and the police do not show up give them the benefit of the doubt and wait 5 minutes if they then do not show you may leave. If this happens you can go and rob another store but if the police don't show then wait an 1hour to do another one. DO NOT ROB ANYTHING WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF A RESTART

                                        Before committing a robbery on another player you are required to have a minimum of 45 second interaction with the individual before initiating on said player. As well as do not pocket wipe people in robberies only take things that you really need.
                                        If you have a weapon and are planning to shoot at another gang,cops or anyone else make sure that you act in a realistic manner and plan out your actions before you decide to shoot, act like the cops have plenty of units as backup as well as act like the cops are close by and will respond.

                                        If you are selling drugs on your “block” and since we all know the cops get alerted you should not just sit on the block and trap all day knowing that the cops are most likely on their way to your location so finish your sale and then move on.
                                        <br>

                                        You are a criminal so stop tweeting out after you win a scenario from the PD etc. PUNISHMENTS WILL BE GIVING OUT IF THIS CONTINUES ! 
                                        <br>

                                        If someone pulls out a gun this counts as initiation on whoever the guns is pulled and the other player can initiate on you now

                                        You are not to go and stick someone up at PD or inside PD to get your boy out, this rule also applies to pillbox when your friends/gang member is arrested you are not to follow and metagaming the information into pillbox and take your boy out of custody an hold up a cop for him this can not go on and bans will be handed out but, you can if the RP scene is brought into greenzone can continue it and if there are issues then you clip and open a ticket. Now with this being said you are allowed to continue a scene into said “greenzone” but if you were not part of the original chase you have to wait until they leave the green zone. Ex. Police arrest a member of the bloods. The bloods members know that their boy got arrested and go and wait at the pillbox to hold the cop up to get their boy out. THIS IS WHAT NOT TO DO !!!!!!!!!!!! What you can do is if you are in the original pursuit you can follow the cop to said greenzone and act appropriately but remember to have a clipping software because if a ticket gets made we need to see that you were originally part of the chase etc.

                                        Gangs are allowed to start brawls with each other but remember you don't have to rob everyone because you won the scenario and if I see this bans will be given out. Ex. If you are by yourself and you are still repping your flag and people make comments/sly remarks about your gang you are entitled to stand your ground and not back down but think smartly because if its a 1v4 you would realistically not hook off and start a brawl/fight cause you know your losing it but if the person who started the whole interaction hooks off you are allowed to fight back because you are standing your ground. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS HAVE CLIPPING SOFTWARE RUNNING !!!!!	
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If you have a color and rep that flag or jacket etc. you when doing crime must not wear these things because it puts a big target on your back and IRL(Which I hate relating to) but if you are doing crime you are not wearing things that you would get ID'd from. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If you hold down a drug you are allowed to tax people but if new people come around do not be an asshole and not allow them to pick but instead just tax them on their amount that they get but taxing can not be over 15k. If you have an issue with another gang and they pull up to that spot then you are allowed to press them out of the drug area and start an issue with them. But still remember all rules still apply no matter what ! 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Vehicles that are none other than a truck and a dirtbike are not to be driven off road and especially DO NOT EVER JUMP OFF OF A MOUNTAIN IN ANY VEHICLE THAT IS NVL !!!!!!    
                                        <br>

                                         If you are in a chase and are currently fleeing from PD in a vehicle that you own or even is stolen, make sure that after you lose the cops(If you don't get caught) to go and change clothes as well as switch vehicles cause the PD will ID you based off of that as well as i've been told that plenty of crims stay at the appts because they feel that it's a gray zone where PD can't do nothing. PD is entitled to arrest you or whatever else at apartments as long as rules are not broken as well as the same thing goes for you as the crim, and remember if you run into your apartment and PD catches you doing that after they seen you with a class 2 etc. they will and are allowed to right up a warrant to raid your apartment so don't be surprised when they come knocking at the door. There are now storage units, vehicle storage as well so be smart as a criminal and don't mauld if you are caught.

                                         You can not do a robbery with two vehicles, you can only use one vehicle and then later on in the chase vehicle swap. You can not do getaways on a bike at the start, meaning you can use bikes but not instantly you have to be in a car and then swap to bikes. 
                                         <br>
                                         <br>
                                         You are not to go and drive to apartments while in a chase with PD and swap vehicles, also you are not to put your vehicle in the garage and pull it out hence fixing the car without having to pay for a repair. 
                                         <br>
                                         <br>
                                         When doing a bank robbery, store robbery, any type of robbery there is a rule for the amount of people always in play. This rule only changes when there are gang shootouts on gang turf. Make sure that you still remember prior rules and obey them so that you don't break any other rules that are in play.
                                         <br>
                                         <br>
                                         When you are in a traffic stop do not flee instantly solely based on the fact that the vehicle is stolen. Provide the cops with the same RP that you want in return !!!!!!!!
                                         <br>
                                         <br>
                                         When you are in a shootout with another party and you go down, you must not enter that scene again until it is over ! Even if you are shot at again just put your hands up and walk away if you end up going down make sure to have clipping software to clip you getting killed after getting revived. BANS WILL BE GIVEN IF YOU FALL TO FOLLOW THIS RULE !
